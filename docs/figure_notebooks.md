# Notebooks to recreate figures

## Prerequisite
To run the notebooks make sure you are using the aidhs_env environment 

## Figure 1
AID-HS overview figure, composite of:
- Hippocampal segmentations and surfaces using `plot_hippunfold_toolbox.ipynb`
- Characterisation of HS with normative curve from `analysis_normative_curves.ipynb`
- Characterisation of asymmetries from `analysis_asymmetries_patients.ipynb`
- Outputs from individualised reports created with AID-HS pipeline

## Figure 2
Characterisation of morphological abnormalities in HS:
- normative curves from `analysis_normative_curves.ipynb`
- analysis of asymmetries from `analysis_asymmetries_patients.ipynb`

## Figure 3
Examples of AID-HS reports created with AID-HS pipeline

## Supplementary Figure 1
